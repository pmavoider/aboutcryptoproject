                    <p class="text-center mt-4">
                        A cryptocurrency, or coin is a digital currency designed to work as a medium of exchange through a computer network that is not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or bank, to uphold or maintain it. It allows a peer-to-peer transaction system that can enable anyone anywhere to send and receive payments. Instead of being physical money carried around and exchanged in the real world, cryptocurrency payments exist purely as digital entries to an online database describing specific transactions. When you transfer cryptocurrency funds, the transactions are recorded in a public ledger. Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets. Despite their name, cryptocurrencies are not considered to be currencies in the traditional sense and while varying treatments have been applied to them, including classification as commodities, securities, as well as currencies, cryptocurrencies are generally viewed as a distinct asset class in practice. Some crypto schemes use validators to maintain the cryptocurrency.

                    <p class="text-center mt-4">
                       While there were attempts to make digital curreny before bitcoin. The new era of crypto currency began on October 31, 2008. Satoshi Nakamoto published the white paper called Bitcoin  A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System, describing the functionality of the Bitcoin blockchain network. Satoshi formally began work on the bitcoin project on August 18th, 2008, when they purchased Bitcoin.org. While it is not the subject of this article, it is worth noting that Bitcoin, and all cryptocurrencies, would not be possible without blockchain technology.

                       The history of Bitcoin was now underway. Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first block of the Bitcoin network on January 3, 2009. Satoshi embedded the headline of the newspaper The Times on the first block in order to permanently refer to the economic preconditions that lead to the technology of Bitcoin. This first block of 50 Bitcoins is now referred to as the Genesis Block. Bitcoin had almost no value for the first few months of their existence. Six months after they started trading in April 2010, the value of one Bitcoin was less than 14 cents.

                    <p>
                        The future of cryptocurrency is intimately connected to its considerable social and political impact. Cryptocurrency has the potential to benefit everyone  from the individual citizen to the nation-state. For both, there is increased opportunity for financial inclusion, ownership, and power, at lower cost, increased confidentiality, and better access to a global marketplace. Even seasoned investors are astonished at the potential for return-on-investment.

                        Further, at the political level, investing in blockchain offers an increased capacity for electronic government and digital society, with the potential to strengthen democracy, human rights, the rule of law, and anti-corruption initiatives. Witness Estonia’s E-residency system, which offers numerous digital benefits that most authoritarian governments would never dream of giving their citizens.
                        
                        However, it is precisely the incredible potential for economic and political transformation that may slow the evolution and adoption of cryptocurrency. In any system, players who start to lose out on previous benefits will consider defensive countermeasures. China is digitizing its own currency, the yuan, but is cracking down on decentralized cryptocurrencies like bitcoin. Russia is trying to chip away at its dependency on the US Dollar, but is equally nervous about cryptocurrencies; thus, Moscow is buying record amounts of gold. In the West, there is growing concern over cryptocurrency’s large carbon footprint. Remember that governments control your access to the Internet, so they also control your access to cryptocurrency. Here, consider the extent to which cryptocurrency may become associated with criminal, terrorist, or rogue nation use.
